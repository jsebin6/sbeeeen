<h2>HTML로 공부하는중</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target="_blank" title="html5 speicifiacation">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language
for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the
structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the
rendered page. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
 structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</P>
